Static changes like hard-coded colors/values will not count at all (i.e., changing shapes/colors/values that are globally defined and set only once). You may however change such values through game logic during runtime. (i.e., when points are scored, boundaries are hit, some action occurs, etc)</li></ol></li><li>Evidence/Screenshots<ol><li>As best as you can, gather evidence for your first significant change and fill in the deliverable items below.</li><li>As best as you can, gather evidence for your significant change and fill in the deliverable items below.</li><li>Remember to include your ucid/date as comments in any screenshots that have code</li><li>Ensure your screenshots load and are visible from the md file in step 9</li></ol></li><li>In the M6 folder create a new file called m6_submission.md</li><li>Save your below responses, generate the markdown, and paste the output to this file</li><li>Add/commit/push all related files as necessary</li><li>Merge your pull request once you're satisfied with the .md file and the canvas game mods</li><li>Create a new pull request from dev to prod and merge it</li><li>Locally checkout dev and pull the merged changes from step 12</li></ol><p>Each missed or failed to follow instruction is eligible for -0.25 from the final grade</p></td></tr></table>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this assignment and the related HTML5 Canvas readings (at least a few sentences for full credit)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>During this assignment I learned how HTML5 brings a lot of new usage<br>to HTML. There are serious improvements for making games, such as canvas. In<br>my opinion, the canvas aspect of HTML5 is really what makes it special.<br>It&#39;s super cool how in addition to having 2D features, HTML5 also supports<br>3D features. I haven&#39;t really used anything from HTML5 before or during my<br>Bank Project, but using it for this homework assignment was a good introduction<br>to how it works and why it&#39;s useful.<br></p><br></td></tr>
